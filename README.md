## Overview
HABITUP was my final project for GAâ€™s Software Engineering course and another full-stack app but this time using Python and Django for the backend. I decided to work on my own for this last project to fully experience all aspects of working on both the front- and backends.

## <a name="brief"></a>Brief  
* Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own front-end
* Use a Python Django API using Django REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database
* Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React
* Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models

## Timeframe
1 week

### Planning
The idea for this app came about largely due to a book Iâ€™d read recently, which had helped me design a better daily system and environment for myself in order to cultivate better habits - and it could not have come at a better time going into this course! This brought about the idea of having an interactive, social way of tracking oneâ€™s habits. 

Day 1 was spent planning. I knew from previous projects that this was vital and you can never plan enough! I used Trello to set out my daily tasks and got to work on building out the relationships first, seen as this would be integral to the build of the backend. I used Quick Database Diagrams to produce an ERD:

## <a name="improvements"></a>Future improvements 
* Re-factoring and making the app more accessible would be high on my list of improvements as I'm keen on making sites that everyone can use
* If Iâ€™d had more time I would have incorporated either Stripeâ€™s or PayPalâ€™s test payment environment to mimic actual payment, rather than just using design on the front-end like I did
* Dynamically update the calendar based on the days the user had said they had completed a habit
* Have a chat function between users on the forum
